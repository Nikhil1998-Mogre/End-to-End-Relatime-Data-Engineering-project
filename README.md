The tools we will be using in this project are:

1) Azure Data Factory
2) Azure Synapse Analytics
3) Azure Databricks
4) Azure Data Lake
5) Azure Active Directory
6) Azure Key Vault
7) Power BI

Step by Step approach for the project

1. In the data engineering project described, an on-premise MYSQL database is connected to Azure Data Factory using a self-hosted integration runtime(SHIR). This integration runtime is installed on the same machine where the MYSQL database is hosted, allowing Azure Data Factory to securely connect to the on-premise database.
